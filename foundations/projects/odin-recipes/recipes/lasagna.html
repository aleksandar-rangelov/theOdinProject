            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce</strong>: In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until it's browned and crumbled. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until they become translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce</strong>: In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to create a smooth paste (roux). Cook for 1-2 minutes until it turns a pale golden color. Gradually whisk in the milk, and continue whisking until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. Season with ground nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Remove from heat.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Layer the Lasagna</strong>: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, start assembling the lasagna. Begin with a layer of cooked lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, a layer of ricotta cheese, and a sprinkle of Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Repeat this layering until all ingredients are used, finishing with a final layer of noodles and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Bake</strong>: Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Serve</strong>: Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Slice and serve the delicious layers of beefy, cheesy goodness to your eager guests.</p></li>
