        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless ribeye steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Prepare the Steaks</strong>: Start by taking the ribeye steaks out of the refrigerator and allowing them to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. This ensures even cooking. Season both sides generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Sear the Steaks</strong>: Heat a heavy skillet or cast-iron pan over high heat. Add the olive oil and let it get hot, but not smoking. Carefully place the seasoned steaks in the pan and sear for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust cooking time according to your desired level of doneness). During the last minute of cooking, add half of the minced garlic to the pan, allowing it to infuse the steak with its flavor. Transfer the steaks to a plate and cover loosely with foil to rest.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>the Garlic Butter Sauce</strong>: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining minced garlic and butter. Stir continuously, allowing the butter to melt and the garlic to become fragrant and slightly golden. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Serve</strong>: Pour the garlic butter sauce over the rested steaks. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley for a burst of color and freshness. Slice the steaks against the grain and serve immediately. Pair with your favorite side dishes like mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables for a complete and luxurious meal.</p></li>
