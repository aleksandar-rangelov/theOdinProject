        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package (16 ounces) filo dough, thawed</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Bulgarian feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sparkling water or club soda</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

            <p>Optional</p>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons sesame seeds or poppy seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Prepare the Filling</strong>: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the crumbled feta cheese and plain yogurt. Mix until well combined. Season the mixture with a pinch of salt and a dash of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Assemble the Banitsa</strong>: Carefully unroll the filo dough and cover it with a damp kitchen towel to prevent it from drying out. Place one sheet of filo dough into the greased baking dish, allowing the edges to hang over the sides. Brush it with melted butter. Repeat this process, layering and buttering each sheet until you have used about half of the filo dough.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Add the Filling</strong>: Pour the egg and cheese mixture evenly over the layered filo dough.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Finish Layering</strong>: Continue layering the remaining sheets of filo dough, brushing each one with melted butter. Pour the sparkling water or club soda over the top layer of filo dough to help it become crispy.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Bake</strong>: Bake the banitsa in the preheated oven for about 40-50 minutes, or until it turns golden brown and crispy on top.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Serve</strong>: Remove the banitsa from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Optionally, sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds over the top for added flavor and texture. Cut the banitsa into squares or triangles and serve warm.</p></li>
